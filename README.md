# Smart-Cart-System-Contiki
– Created a Contiki-based IoT application where multiple mobile sink nodes, using the Manhattan mobility model, collect
data from static sensor nodes.
– The system utilizes a UDP client-server model and integrates the Collect View tool to visualize data transmission and
network metrics.
